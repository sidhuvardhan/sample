1. First install git in chrome 64 or 32 size bit as per requirement of system
2. Allow all requirements and location which you want to download
3. And open git bash on windows button
4. Enter git on the terminal
5. If it shows all the data about git folder then it is working ,other wise reninstall 
6. configuring git with git hub
   git config --global user.name("enter name of your git hub account as it is)
   git config --global user.email("enter email of your git hub account as it is")
7. Open git folder which was created during installtion of git on any desired disc
8. Create a new folder in that git folder to store new git files
9. Open a git bash on that file and enter ls -a
         if it shows only two dots,then it is not git repository
         to connect with git hub we need to convert folder into repository
10.open the git bash on that folder ,then apply "git init"(to convert files into repository)
11. then again ls -a
         now it will show git (so it becomes repository)
12 .we need to add that repositories into staging level
  so (git add --all)
13.then check status of the repository 
    (git status)
14. after that we need to commit for conformation ,along with message
   git commit -m "message which you want to show on your tracking system
15.and then we need to push this local repositories into git hub repositories
  so we need to connect git to git hub 
   git remote add orgin (remote name),sometimes it would be "main"  .link of your git hub
16. after linking ,then push the repo into git hub
    git push remotename branch name
    git push oringin master
Note: whenever we change our code in our local system,then always add to stage level,and then commit
